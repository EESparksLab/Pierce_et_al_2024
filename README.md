The script associated with Pierce_et_al_2024 is included here.

The R script included in this directory is used to analyze 3-point bend data extracted from the Bluehill software (steps 31-33 of the protocol). The first part of the script runs a linear regression, where Flexure Displacement (mm) is the independent variable and Force (N) is the dependent variable. The slope of the linear regression is extracted and this value is the structural stiffness (K). The Vertical (parallel) and Horizontal (perpendicular) Specimen Diameters are used to calculate a0 and b0, which are then used to calculate the second moment of area (I) and the structural bending modulus (E). Note, within this script, a fixture span length of 17.5 mm is used to calculate the structural bending modulus, however, this value should be updated to match the fixture span length used in each individual setup.
